# ts-depDraw
Visualisation of typescript project dependencies.


The idea of this project is to create a dependency graph of your project.



Need to do the following.

- Experiment with how to display the data collected.
    - Maybe with a stack?
- Get rid of duplicate reference
    - And tick isDefinition, and fill in end of definition using define.

- Write some server tests.
- Write more tsServer tests.
